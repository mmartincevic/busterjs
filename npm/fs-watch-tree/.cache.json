It\nuses [node-inotify](https://github.com/c4milo/node-inotify) to watch for\nchanges, thus only works on Linux at the moment. Help adding support for\n[NodeJS-FSEvents](https://github.com/phidelta/NodeJS-FSEvents) for OSX would be\nappreciated.\n\nNote that this library is likely a temporary one, as\n[Node will likely support](https://github.com/joyent/libuv/issues/68) recursive\ndirectory watches cross-platform through **libuv** sometime soon-ish.\n\nThe API conciously does not expose any inotify internals directly in order to\nease the addition of FSEvents support down the road.\n\n## Synopsis ##\n\n    var watchTree = require(\"watch-tree\").watchTree;\n\n    var watch = watchTree(\"/home/christian\", function (event) {\n        // See description of event below\n    });\n\n    watch.end(); // Release watch\n\n    watch = watchTree(\"/home/christian\", {\n        exclude: [\"node_modules\", \"~\", \"#\", /^\\./]\n    }, function (event) {\n        // Respond to change\n    });\n\n## `watchTree(dir, callback)` ##\n\nWatches directory `dir` recursively for changes. Only a subset of the inotify\nevents are supported; create file/diretory, modify file/directory and delete\nfile/directory. Other events, such as access, is not currently supported. This\nlimitation is simply the result of my YAGNI approach. Other events may be added\nlater if necessary.\n\nThe callback is called with an `event` object. The event is described below.\n\n## `watchTree(dir, options, callback)` ##\n\nWatch a directory recursively, with some specific options. Currently, you can\nonly specify a single option:\n\n    { exclude: [] }\n\nThe `exclude` array specifies file patterns to exclude from watches. If a\npattern matches a directory, `watch-tree` will not recurse into it. If it\nmatches a file, changes to that file will not trigger an event.\n\nThe excludes can be either strings or regular expressions, but are always\ntreated as regular expressions. That means that\n\n    { exclude: [\".git\", \"node_modules\"] }\n\nWill be treated the same way as:\n\n    { exclude: [new RegExp(\".git\"), new RegExp(\"node_modules\")] }\n\nIf you only want to exclude specific files, be sure to provide full\npaths. `watch-tree` does not expand paths, it will resolve all paths relative to\nthe original directory. So this:\n\n    watchFile(\".git\", function (event) { /* ... *) });\n\nWill watch (and consider excludes for) directories like `.git/branches`. And\nthis:\n\n    watchFile(\"/home/christian/projects/watch-tree/.git\", function (event) {});\n\nWill watch (and consider excludes for) directories like\n`/home/christian/projects/watch-tree/.git`.\n\n## `event` ##\n\nThe event object has the following properties:\n\n### `name` ###\n\nThe full (relative) path to the file/directory that changed. As far as I know,\nthis will not be available with FSEvents, so it may go away.\n\n### `isDirectory()` ###\n\nReturns true if the cause of the change was a directory. Same challenge as\n`name`.\n\n### `isFile()` ###\n\nReturns true if the cause of the change was a file. Same challenge as `name`.\n\n### `isCreate()` ###\n\nReturns true if the cause of the event was a newly created file/directory.\n\n### `isDelete()` ###\n\nReturns true if the cause of the event was a deleted file/directory.\n\n### `isModify()` ###\n\nReturns true if the cause of the event was a modified file/directory.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"cjohansen","email":"christian@cjohansen.no"},{"name":"augustl","email":"august@augustl.com"}],"time":{"0.1.0":"2012-04-17T20:16:07.492Z","0.2.0":"2012-04-28T23:05:13.828Z","0.2.1":"2012-06-20T21:31:59.671Z","0.2.2":"2012-07-09T22:30:21.878Z"},"author":{"name":"Christian Johansen","email":"christian@cjohansen.no","url":"http://cjohansen.no"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/busterjs/fs-watch-tree.git"},"users":{"gillesruppert":true},"_attachments":{"fs-watch-tree-0.2.2.tgz":{"content_type":"application/octet-stream","revpos":10,"digest":"md5-vEl8YvDTKuHWZg/lNKM74w==","length":11373,"stub":true},"fs-watch-tree-0.2.1.tgz":{"content_type":"application/octet-stream","revpos":7,"digest":"md5-dyggofPle1VfMg7KdU6ZMQ==","length":11356,"stub":true},"fs-watch-tree-0.2.0.tgz":{"content_type":"application/octet-stream","revpos":5,"digest":"md5-WIl9IwP2JjOaFRk4gOFhfg==","length":11171,"stub":true},"fs-watch-tree-0.1.0.tgz":{"content_type":"application/octet-stream","revpos":3,"digest":"md5-lkE2LN+r0wx2k1Jo/9Y+ow==","length":5037,"stub":true}},"_etag":"\"6NLW1Y5181FZPQ5FJ1BMVYOFH\""}
